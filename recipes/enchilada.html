        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 lb skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
                <li>2 tsp kosher salt, divided</li>
                <li>2 tsp chili powder, divided</li>
                <li>1.5 tsp ground cumin, divided</li>
                <li>12 flour tortillas (6 in)</li>
                <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
                <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 medium poblano pepper, seeded, and chopped</li>
                <li>1 small yellow bell pepper, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 can diced tomatoes (10 oz) and green chiles</li>
                <li>Half 8 oz package cream cheese</li>
                <li>4 oz sour cream</li>
                <li>4 cups shredded Cheddar-Monterery Jack cheese blend, divided</li>
                <li>1 cup refried beans</li>
                <li>1 can red enchilada sauce (15 oz)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Place chicken on a large sheet of foil and season with 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon chili powder, and 1/2 teaspoon cumin. Seal the foil around the chicken and place the packet on a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tender and no longer pink in the center, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Shred cooked chicken and set aside. Increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>While chicken cooks, prepare tortillas. Spread both sides of each tortilla lightly with butter.</li>
                <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Toast each tortilla, about 10 seconds on each side, and set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, poblano pepper, and bell pepper and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Add remaining salt, chili powder, and cumin and cook, stirring frequently, until veggies are very tender, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in tomatoes and cream cheese. Cook, stirring constantly, until cheese has melted. Remove from heat and stir in sour cream and 2 cups Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend.</li>
                <li>Spread about 1 tablespoon refried beans, if using, in the center of a tortilla. Add about 1/4 cup chicken filling and roll up to seal. Repeat with remaining beans and filling. Pour 1/4 cup sauce in the bottom of 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange enchiladas in a single layer over the sauce. Pour remaining enchilada sauce over the top and spread to evenly coat. Sprinkle with remaining cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, about 30 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving with desired toppings.</li>
